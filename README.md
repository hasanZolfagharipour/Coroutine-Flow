# **About this book**
Coroutines are the recommended solution in Kotlin and Android for
writing concurrent and asynchronous code. There are so many good
documents, books and especially articles on the web that it can be
useful if they are combined in one place, which is exactly the idea of
this book. It includes official documents of kotlinlang and Google, also
articles and books of engineers and developers of these companies, as
well as experts in this field that are referenced. But by changing or
adding examples and descriptions while respecting the originality, it
has made this book, a valuable modern resource. Therefore, this book is
useful for all those who want to start learning Coroutine-Flow but are
lost in the mass of contents and don't know where to start. This is a
free book for your personal use only. You are NOT allowed to sell this
book. If you have any suggestions or corrections regarding this book,
please send them to me.

**Note:** This book is not the final version, currently it only contains
the first chapter (Coroutine) and the othre two chapters, Channel and
Flow, are coming soon.
